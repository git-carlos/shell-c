# Simulated Shell in C
Constructed by Carlos Pantoja-Malaga & Stanley Vossler.

Revisions done by Carlos Pantoja-Malaga for GitHub Repository ```shell-c```.

## Description
Through the compilation and execution of the program file, the program simulates a basic bash shell constructed in C. The program facilates the parsing of user input through its prompt and is able to recognize environment variables, piping, i/o redirection, background processing, and execute built-in and external commands.

In order to compile `shell.c` you should download both `shell.c` and `makefile`. In the respective directory you can run the `make` command and then execute the shell through either `shell` or `./shell`.
